# Ciciara

> Ciciara is a vuejs based real time chat that offers multi room functionally.

## Why

This is a fork of an internal project of my company which is a fully fledge realtime chat that has been dismissed in favor for Microsoft Teams and Discord. We used that back when Slack was the only options, and Slack sucks.

## But the code is not old

Again it's a fork, the original version was built with C# and other technologies, this is just the same but with a different stack that I'm comfortable with

## What does "ciciara" mean

It's an Italian slang from the North Italy which means can be translated to "A guy that is talking too much"

## How can I use this

### Client

Client is located in the `client` folder, change directory into it and run `yarn install` and then `yarn serve` to locally serve it.

### Server

The server source code is located in `server` but you can leverage the handy `docker-compose.yml` file to generate a small node-based container that will host the server for you
